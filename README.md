In this challenge, we were asked to use machine learning to score 2020 loan data and assess whether a loan was low risk or high risk.

We trained the models using loan data from the entire 2019 year.

First we ran the data through two models, Logistic Regression and Random Forest Classifier, using unscaled data.

Second we scaled the data and ran it again through both models.

Before running both models, I made predictions as to which model would perform better.  After running the model, I evaluated my predictions to see how well my predictions stood against the results.
